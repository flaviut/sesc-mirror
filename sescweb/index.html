    <H4>Welcome to the SESC simulation environment homepage</H4>

    SESC is built in the Department of Computer Science at
    Urbana-Champaign in the <A HREF="http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu">IACOMA group</A>.

    <BR></BR> <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sesc">SESC
    Sourceforge home page</A> <BR></BR> Another simulator??? <B>Choice
    is good</B>. Although Simplescalar and RSIM are wonderful
    simulators, I believe that Simplescalar is having too much weight
    in the computer architecture research community. SESC tries to
    provide an alternative to well known simulators.  


    <BR></BR> We expect that most of the people would use the
    simulator for their "papers". In that situation, they would be
    reluctant to update the cvs server with the latest information
    about their work. Our proposal for that situation is the
    following:
    <ul>
      <li>You can work freely with SESC as long as you want. Do not
      commit or report modifications while you are working in your
      paper.
      </li> 

      <li>Once you have published a paper, if and only if you want,
      send us the simulator extensions and we will post them in the
      web-site</li>
    </ul>

    If you have any suggestion/code to improve the performance or the
    simulation accuracy contact us. Personally, I would like more
    people actively working in the simulator (see MAINTAINERS file).
