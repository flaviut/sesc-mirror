    SESC is a cycle accurate architectural simulator. It models a very
    wide set of architectures: single processors, CMPs, PIMs, and
    thread level speculation.

    <p>
    SESC started as the pet project of <A
    HREF="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~renau">Jose Renau</a> while doing
    his PhD at Urbana-Champaign in the <A
    HREF="http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu">IACOMA
    group</A>. Currently, he is a new faculty at <A HREF="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu">University of
    California, Santa Cruz</a>.

    <br>
    Currently, it is used by several research groups at the University
    of Illinois, University of Rochester, North Carolina State
    University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Cornell
    University.

    <p>
    We expect that most researchers would use SESC for their
    "papers". Therefore, they would be reluctant to update the cvs
    server with their current work. We suggest the following options:

    <ul>
      <li>Work freely with SESC as long as you want. Do not commit or
      report modifications while working in a paper.
      </li> 

      <li>Once you have published a paper, <b>if and only if you want</b>,
      send us the simulator extensions and we will post them in the
      web-site.
      </li>

      <li>If you find a bug try to send a patch as soon as possible.
      </li>
    </ul>

    If you have any suggestion/code to improve the performance or the
    simulation accuracy contact us. We believe that the bigger the
    amount of simultaneous improvements, the better for the code
    quality.

    <p>

    Some basic questions/answers about sesc:

    <ul class="noindent">
      <li>
	<b>Why another architecture simulator?</b>
	<br>
	We think that variarety is good, and there should be several
	architecture simulators. This only adds more competition, and
	the result is a better set of tools.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>What is the difference with simplescalar?</b>
	<br>
	SESC models a variety of architectures, including dynamic
	superscalar processors, CMPs, processor-in-memory, and
	speculative multithreading architectures. Simplescalar focuses
	on single processors.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Is it fast?</b>
	<br>
	SESC is very fast. During the whole design performance and
	clarity have been the main focus (more years to graduate was
	not a concern). The result is a simulator that executes over
	1.5MIPS on current pentium4 at 3GHz.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Do you have coding style?</b>
	<br>
	Yes, Renau and Luis are *extremely* picky about style. Read
	the codingStyle guideline. For them, it is very important to
	keep the code clean. Most of the coding time on sesc has been
	refactoring.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Do you want other people to do updates on sesc?</b>
	<br>
	YES. we believe on open development. Please commit your bugs
	as soons as possible, and any new functionality that may be
	interestig to other researchers (Once your paper has been
	accepted, of course).
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Who decides what goes in/out of the simulator?</b>
	<br>
	<A HREF="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/~renau">Jose Renau</a> has
	the ultimate decision of what goes in/out of the simulator. He will
	try to accept changes that the majority
	requests. Nevertheless, remember that he is picky with code
	style and simulator performance.
